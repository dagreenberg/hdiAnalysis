GitHub uses README.md to make the page you see on GitHub). See pacea if want to

An R package for calculating and plotting highest density intervals

This package accompanies the manuscript:

*Reducing uncertainty in stock assessments by billions of fish*

by Andrew M. Edwards and Marie Auger-Méthé, being submitted shortly to the
*Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*.

The manuscript (available upon request) should be read first to understand the potential of the
package. Two rendered vignettes are designed to help users investigate
highest density intervals for their own applications. The vignettes include
examples of our simple plotting
functions to help understand and
check calculated HDIs, plus code to streamline the calculation of HDIs for time series of MCMC
values and to produce simple summary tables of results.

The two vignettes are rendered and viewable on the GitHub site, and are:

* [results.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results.html)
  -- Designed as a template for users to analyse their own data, by reproducing the results in
  the manuscript as an example.
* [results-extra.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-extra.html)
  -- Includes further results, calculations, explanations, and figure options.

To run and adapt the code yourself, simply download the raw R Markdown files
from
[results.Rmd](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results.Rmd)
or [results-extra.Rmd](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-extra.Rmd).
Run the file locally, and then adapt it for your own data.

## Installation

To install the latest version just:

```
install.packages("remotes")    # If you do not already have the "remotes" package

remotes::install_github("andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis")
```

If you get an error like
```
Error in utils::download.file(....)
```
then the connection may be timing out (this happens to us on the DFO network). Try

```
options(timeout = 1200)
```
and then try and install again. If you get a different error then post an Issue
or contact <a href="mailto:andrew.edwards@dfo-mpo.gc.ca">Andy</a> for help.

The `report` folder contains early exploratory investigations and analyses for
other examples not included in the manuscript, and are not intended for packages
users (all the data are not pushed to GitHub so the code likely can't be run
anyway).
